## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses `:focus` and `:valid` pseudo-classes to trigger label animation  
- `<label>` floats above the `<input>` when focused or filled  
- `<i>` acts as an animated expanding underline  
- Transitions and transforms provide smooth visual feedback  
- Custom button design with hover effects and gradient background
